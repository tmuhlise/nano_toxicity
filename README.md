This repository contains the code and workflows for an interpretable two-stage machine learning (ML) nano-QSAR framework developed to predict the toxicity and biological effects of metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs).
The framework integrates physicochemical descriptors, exposure conditions, and an intermediate Toxicity Class to improve prediction accuracy and biological interpretability
